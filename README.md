## Project 1 - Build My World
I spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge architectural structure tailored to facilitate seamless navigation for our fleet of intelligent robots within the workspace. Leveraging this state-of-the-art building, we strategically deployed multiple instances of our advanced robotic systems, aligning them seamlessly with the infrastructure. To augment their capabilities and create a truly dynamic environment, I spearheaded the creation of a specialized plugin, enabling effortless interaction with the robotic ecosystem and the integrated world at large.

#### Build the workspace
To navigate to the build directory and build the robot, follow the below command.

```
cd Project1-BuildMyWorld/build
cmake ..
make
```

To Open the Production world in Gazebo with a build in Interactive Plugin, then follow the below command

```
gazebo ../world/MyProductionBuilding
cd ../.. 
```
